	Welcome to the July issue of CCR, an issue that should hopefully 
inspire a number of discussions that we can continue in person during 
Sigcomm, in Chicago. This issue features 17 papers, 5 of which are 
editorial notes, and 12 technical contributions from our community. The 
technical part features novel contributions in the area of router 
location inference, performance of fiber-to-the-home networks, BGP, 
programmable middleboxes, and a programming language for protocol 
independent packet processors. Each one of them is advancing the state 
of the art and should be a useful building block for future research. 
The research community is increasingly becoming multidisciplinary. One 
cannot help but get inspired when he/she sees the elegance of solutions 
that address real problems in one discipline while exploiting knowledge 
produced in another. This is the mission of the fifth technical 
submission in this issue. The core of the contribution is to adopt the 
concept of design contests and apply it to the area of congestion 
control protocols in wireless networks. The authors point out that one 
of the key requirements in any design contest is to “have an 
unambigious, measurable objective that will allow one to compare 
protocols”. And this is exactly what the authors do in their work. The 
article concludes that design contests can benefit networking research, 
if designed properly, and they encourage others to explore their 
strengths and weaknesses. The remaining papers of the technical part are
 devoted to one of the largest efforts undertaken in the recent years to
 rethink the architecture of the Internet, e.g. the Future Internet 
Architecture program of the U.S. National Science Foundation. FIA 
targets the design of a trustworthy Internet, that incorporates 
societal, economical, and legal constraints, while following a clean 
slate approach. It was the initiative of Prof. David Wetherall, from 
University of Washington, to bring the four FIA proposals, and 
affiliated project ChoiceNet, to CCR, and provide a very comprehensive 
exposition of the different avenues taken by the different consortia. I 
have to thank David for acm all the hard work he did in order to bring 
all the pieces in the same place, something that will undoubtedly help 
our community understand the FIA efforts in a greater extent. The FIA 
session is preceded by a technical note by Dr. Darleen Fisher, FIA 
program director at the U.S. National Science Foundation. It is 
inspiring to see how a long term (11-year) funding effort has led to a 
number of functioning components that may define the Internet of the 
future. Thank you Darleen for a wonderful introductory note! Our 
editorial session comprises 5 papers. Two of the papers cover workshop 
reports: i) the workshop on Internet Economics 2013, and ii) the 
roundtable on real time communications research, that was held along 
with IPTComm, in October 2013. We have an article introducing the 
ProtoRINA prototype, a user-space prototype of the Recursive 
InterNetwork Architecture (RINA), and a qualitative study of the 
Internet census data that was collected in March 2013, and that has 
attracted significant attention in our community. The last editorial is 
appearing in CCR per my own invitation to its author, Daniel Stenberg. 
By the end of this year the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) is 
aiming to standardize the second version of HTTP, i.e. HTTP 2.0. This 
new version is going to be a very significant change compared to HTTP v1
 aiming to provide better support for mobile browsing. Daniel is a 
Mozilla engineer participating in the standardization of HTTP 2.0 and 
has kindly accepted to publish his thoughts on HTTP 2.0 at CCR. This 
issue also marks the start of tenure for Dr. Aline Carneiro Viana, from 
INRIA. Aline is bringing a lot of energy to the editorial board and her 
expertise in ad hoc, sensor networks, delay tolerant networks, and

	In this paper we focus on geolocating Internet routers, using a 
methodology for extracting and decoding geography-related strings from 
fully qualified domain names (hostnames). We first compiled an extensive
 dictionary associating geographic strings (e.g., airport codes) with 
geophysical locations. We then searched a large set of router hostnames 
for these strings, assuming each autonomous naming domain uses 
geographic hints consistently within that domain. We used topology and 
performance data continually collected by our global measurement 
infrastructure to discern whether a given hint appears to co-locate 
different hostnames in which it is found. Finally, we generalized 
geolocation hints into domain-specific rule sets. We generated a total 
of 1,711 rules covering 1,398 different domains and validated them using
 domain-specific ground truth we gathered for six domains. Unlike 
previous efforts which relied on labor-intensive domain-specific manual 
analysis, we automate our process for inferring the domain specific 
heuristics, substantially advancing the state-of-the-art of methods for 
geolocating Internet resources.</p></div>

	Researchers depend on public BGP data to understand the structure and 
evolution of the AS topology, as well as the operational security and 
resiliency of BGP. BGP data is provided voluntarily by network operators
 who establish BGP sessions with route collectors that record this data.
 In this paper, we show how trivial it is for a single vantage point 
(VP) to introduce thousands of spurious routes into the collection by 
providing examples of ﬁve VPs that did so. We explore the impact these 
misbehaving VPs had on AS relationship inference, showing these 
misbehaving VPs introduced thousands of AS links that did not exist, and
 caused relationship inferences for links that did exist to be 
corrupted. We evaluate methods to automatically identify misbehaving 
VPs, although we ﬁnd the result unsatisfying because the limitations of 
real-world BGP practices and AS relationship inference algorithms 
produce signatures similar to those created by misbehaving VPs. The most
 recent misbehaving VP we discovered added thousands of spurious routes 
for nine consecutive months until 8 November 2012. This misbehaving VP 
barely impacts (0.1%) our validation of our AS relationship inferences, 
but this number may be misleading since most of our validation data 
relies on BGP and RPSL which validates only existing links, rather than 
asserting the non-existence of links. We have only a few assertions of 
non-existent routes, all received via our public-facing website that 
allows operators to provide validation data through our interactive 
feedback mechanism. We only discovered this misbehavior because two 
independent operators corrected some inferences, and we noticed that the
 spurious routes all came from the same VP. This event highlights the 
limitations of even the best available topology data, and provides 
additional evidence that comprehensive ground truth validation from 
operators is essential to scientific research on Internet topology.</p></div>

	Fiber-To-The-Home (FTTH) networks are on the brink of bringing 
significantly higher capacity to residential users compared to today'ss 
commercial residential options. There are several burgeoning FTTH 
networks that provide capacities of up to 1 Gbps. We have been 
monitoring one such operational network the Case Connection Zone - for 
23 months. In this paper we seek to understand the extent to which the 
users in this network are in fact making use of the provided 
bi-directional 1 Gbps capacity. We find that even when given virtually 
unlimited capacity the majority of the time users do not retrieve 
information from the Internet in excess of commercially available data 
rates and transmit at only modestly higher rates than commodity networks
 support. Further, we find that end host issues - most prominently 
buffering at both end points - are often the cause of the 
lower-than-expected performance.</p></div>

	With only access billing no longer ensuring profits, an ISP's growth 
now relies on rolling out new and differentiated services. However, ISPs
 currently do not have a well-defined architecture for rapid, 
cost-effective, and scalable dissemination of new services. We present 
iSDF, a new SDN-enabled framework that can meet an ISP's service 
delivery constraints concerning cost, scalability, deployment 
flexibility, and operational ease. We show that meeting these 
constraints necessitates an SDN philosophy for a centralized management 
plane, a decoupled (from data) control plane, and a programmable data 
plane at customer premises. We present an ISP service delivery framework
 (iSDF) that provides ISPs a domain-specific API for network function 
virtualization by leveraging a programmable middlebox built from 
commodity home-routers. It also includes an application server to 
disseminate, configure, and update ISP services. We develop and report 
results for three diverse ISP applications that demonstrate the 
practicality and flexibility of iSDF, namely distributed VPN (control 
plane decisions), pay-per-site (rapid deployment), and BitTorrent 
blocking (data plane processing).</p></div>

	In fields like data mining and natural language processing, design 
contests have been successfully used to advance the state of the art. 
Such contests offer an opportunity to bring the excitement and 
challenges of protocol design - one of the core intellectual elements of
 research and practice in networked systems - to a broader group of 
potential contributors, whose ideas may prove important. Moreover, it 
may lead to an increase in the number of students, especially 
undergraduates or those learning via online courses, interested in 
pursuing a career in the field. We describe the creation of the 
infrastructure and our experience with a protocol design contest 
conducted in MIT's graduate Computer Networks class. This contest 
involved the design and evaluation of a congestion-control protocol for 
paths traversing cellular wireless networks. One key to the success of a
 design contest is an unambiguous, measurable objective to compare 
protocols. In practice, protocol design is the art of trading off 
conflicting goals with each other, but in this contest, we specified 
that the goal was to maximize log(throughput/delay). This goal is a good
 match for applications such as video streaming or videoconferencing 
that care about high throughput and low interactive delays. Some 
students produced protocols whose performance was better than published 
protocols tackling similar goals. Furthermore, the convex hull of the 
set of all student protocols traced out a tradeoff curve in the 
throughput-delay space, providing useful insights into the entire space 
of possible protocols. We found that student protocols diverged in 
performance between the training and testing traces, indicating that 
some students had overtrained ("overfitted") their protocols to the 
training trace. Our conclusion is that, if designed properly, such 
contests could benefit networking research by making new proposals more 
easily reproducible and amenable to such "gamification," improve 
networked systems, and provide an avenue for outreach.</p></div>

	The Future Internet Architectures (FIA) constitutes a 10year effort by 
the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) that was launched in 2006, 
with the announcement of the Future INternet Design (FIND) research area
 within a Network Technologies and Systems (NeTS) program solicitation. 
This solicitation outlined a three-phase program to "rethink" the 
Internet, beginning with FIND and culminating in the recently announced 
two-year awards for Future Internet ArchitectureNext Phase (FIA-NP). 
Because many readers may not be familiar with the thinking behind this 
effort, this article aims to provide a historical context and background

	Motivated by limitations in today's host-centric IP network, recent 
studies have proposed clean-slate network architectures centered around 
alternate first-class principals, such as content, services, or users. 
However, much like the hostcentric IP design, elevating one principal 
type above others hinders communication between other principals and 
inhibits the network's capability to evolve. This paper presents the 
eXpressive Internet Architecture (XIA), an architecture with native 
support for multiple principals and the ability to evolve its 
functionality to accommodate new, as yet unforeseen, principals over 
time. We present the results of our ongoing research motivated by and 
building on the XIA architecture, ranging from topics at the physical 
level ("how fast can XIA go") up through to the user level.</p></div>

	The Internet has been a key enabling technology for many new 
distributed applications and services. However, the deployment of new 
protocols and services in the Internet infrastructure itself has been 
sluggish, especially where economic incentives for network providers are
 unclear. In our work, we seek to develop an "economy plane" for the 
Internet that enables network providers to offer new network-based 
services (QoS, storage, etc.) for sale to customers. The explicit 
connection between economic relationships and network services across 
various time scales enables users to select among service alternatives. 
The resulting competition among network service providers will lead to 
overall better technological solutions and more competitive prices. In 
this paper, we present the architectural aspects of our ChoiceNet 
economy plane as well as some of the technological problems that need to
 be addressed in a practical deployment.</p></div>

	Named Data Networking (NDN) is one of five projects funded by the U.S. 
National Science Foundation under its Future Internet Architecture 
Program. NDN has its roots in an earlier project, Content-Centric 
Networking (CCN), which Van Jacobson first publicly presented in 2006.1 
The NDN project investigates Jacobson's proposed evolution from today's 
host-centric network architecture (IP) to a data-centric network 
architecture (NDN). This conceptually simple shift has far-reaching 
implications for how we design, develop, deploy, and use networks and 
applications. We describe the motivation and vision of this new 
architecture, and its basic components and operations. We also provide a
 snapshot of its current design, development status, and research 
challenges. More information about the project, including prototype 
implementations, publications, and annual reports, is available on 
named-data.net.</p></div>

	MobilityFirst is a future Internet architecture with mobility and 
trustworthiness as central design goals. Mobility means that all 
endpoints - devices, services, content, and networks - should be able to
 frequently change network attachment points in a seamless manner. 
Trustworthiness means that the network must be resilient to the presence
 of a small number of malicious endpoints or network routers. 
MobilityFirst enhances mobility by cleanly separating names or 
identifiers from addresses or network locations, and enhances security 
by representing both in an intrinsically verifiable manner, relying upon
 a massively scalable, distributed, global name service to bind names 
and addresses, and to facilitate services including device-to-service, 
multicast, anycast, and context-aware communication, content retrieval, 
and more. A key insight emerging from our experience is that a logically
 centralized global name service can significantly enhance mobility and 
security and transform network-layer functionality. Recognizing and 
validating this insight is the key contribution of the MobilityFirst 
architectural effort.</p></div>

	NEBULA is a proposal for a Future Internet Architecture. It is based on
 the assumptions that: (1) cloud computing will comprise an increasing 
fraction of the application workload offered to an Internet, and (2) 
that access to cloud computing resources will demand new architectural 
features from a network. Features that we have identified include 
dependability, security, flexibility and extensibility, the entirety of 
which constitute resilience. NEBULA provides resilient networking 
services using ultrareliable routers, an extensible control plane and 
use of multiple paths upon which arbitrary policies may be enforced. We 
report on a prototype system, Zodiac, that incorporates these latter two
 features.</p></div>

	P4 is a high-level language for programming protocol-independent packet
 processors. P4 works in conjunction with SDN control protocols like 
OpenFlow. In its current form, OpenFlow explicitly specifies protocol 
headers on which it operates. This set has grown from 12 to 41 fields in
 a few years, increasing the complexity of the specification while still
 not providing the flexibility to add new headers. In this paper we 
propose P4 as a strawman proposal for how OpenFlow should evolve in the 
future. We have three goals: (1) Reconfigurability in the field: 
Programmers should be able to change the way switches process packets 
once they are deployed. (2) Protocol independence: Switches should not 
be tied to any specific network protocols. (3) Target independence: 
Programmers should be able to describe packet processing functionality 
independently of the specifics of the underlying hardware. As an 
example, we describe how to use P4 to configure a switch to add a new 
hierarchical label.</p></div>

	This paper describes a strategy that was designed, implemented, and 
presented at the Mobile Ad Hoc Networking Interoperability and 
Cooperation (MANIAC) Challenge 2013. The theme of the challenge was 
"Mobile Data Offloading" and consisted on developing and comparatively 
evaluating strategies to offload infrastructure access points via 
customer ad hoc forwarding using handheld devices. According to the 
challenge rules, a hop-by-hop bidding contest should decide the path of 
each data packet towards its destination. Consequently, each team should
 rely on other teams' willingness to forward packets for them in order 
to get their traffic across the network. Following these rules, this 
paper proposes a strategy that is based on the concept of how "tight" a 
node is to successfully deliver a packet to its destination within a 
given deadline. This "tightness" idea relies on a shortest-path analysis
 of the underlying network graph, and it is used to define three 
sub-strategies that specify a) how to participate in an auction; b) how 
to announce an auction; and c) how to decide who wins the announced 
auction. The proposed strategy seeks to minimize network resource 
utilization and to promote cooperative behavior among participant nodes.</p></div>

	On March 17, 2013, an Internet census data set and an accompanying 
report were released by an anonymous author or group of authors. It 
created an immediate media buzz, mainly because of the unorthodox and 
unethical data collection methodology (i.e., exploiting default 
passwords to form the Carna botnet), but also because of the alleged 
unprecedented large scale of this census (even though legitimate census 
studies of similar and even larger sizes have been performed in the 
past). Given the unknown source of this released data set, little is 
known about it. For example, can it be ruled out that the data is faked?
 Or if it is indeed real, what is the quality of the released data? The 
purpose of this paper is to shed light on these and related questions 
and put the contributions of this anonymous Internet census study into 
perspective. Indeed, our findings suggest that the released data set is 
real and not faked, but that the measurements suffer from a number of 
methodological flaws and also lack adequate meta-data information. As a 
result, we have not been able to verify several claims that the 
anonymous author(s) made in the published report. In the process, we use
 this study as an educational example for illustrating how to deal with a
 large data set of unknown quality, hint at pitfalls in Internet-scale 
measurement studies, and discuss ethical considerations concerning 
third-party use of this released data set for publications.</p></div>

	On December 12-13 2013, CAIDA and the Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology (MIT) hosted the (invitation-only) 4th interdisciplinary 
Workshop on Internet Economics (WIE) at the University of California's 
San Diego Supercomputer Center. This workshop series provides a forum 
for researchers, commercial Internet facilities and service providers, 
technologists, economists, theorists, policy makers, and other 
stakeholders to inform current and emerging regulatory and policy 
debates. The theme for this year's workshop was the economic health of 
the Internet ecosystem, including emphasis on the cost of and revenue 
sources to support content delivery, the quality of user experience, 
economic and policy influences on and effects of emerging specialized 
services, and the role of data in evaluating ecosystem health. This 
report describes the discussions and presents relevant open research 
questions identified by participants. Slides presented at the workshop 
and a copy of this final report are available at <a href="http://www.caida.org/workshops/wie/1312/" title="http://www.caida.org/workshops/wie/1312/">http://www.caida.org/workshops/wie/1312/</a>.</p></div>

	ProtoRINA is a user-space prototype of the Recursive InterNetwork 
Architecture. RINA is a new architecture that builds on the fundamental 
principle that networking is interprocess communication. As a 
consequence, RINA overcomes inherent weaknesses of the current Internet,
 e.g., security, mobility support, and manageability. ProtoRINA serves 
not only as a prototype that demonstrates the advantages of RINA, but 
also as a network experimental tool that enables users to program 
different policies using its built-in mechanisms. In this note, we 
introduce ProtoRINA as a vehicle for making RINA concepts concrete and 
for encouraging researchers to use and benefit from the prototype.</p></div>
